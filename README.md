# McBride-Enterprise

This is my first project I have ever done. It is centered around a fictional company; McBride's Enterprise. Data was pulled from PowerBi's sample dataset. A preview of the dashboard can be observed below.

I further tried my hand at creating a DBMS using Microsoft Access and attached a preliminary report, and a methodology and reflection report.

This is by no means professional work but just a documentation of my work and applying the skills I've learnt so far.
