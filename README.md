# McBride-Enterprise

This is my first project I have ever done. It is centered around a fictional company; McBride's Enterprise. Data was pulled from PowerBi's sample dataset. A preview of the dashboard can be observed below.

I further tried my hand at creating a DBMS using Microsoft Access.

The prelimnary report gives an overview of the findings and insights that have been made based of the dashboard whilst the methodology and reflection report gives a personal report of what I experienced during the creation of this project.

This is by no means professional work but just a documentation of my work and applying the skills I've learnt so far.
