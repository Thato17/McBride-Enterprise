# McBride-Enterprise

This is my first project I have ever done. It is centered around a fictional company; McBride's Enterprise. Data was pulled from PowerBi's sample dataset. A preview of the dashboard can be observed below.

INSIGHTS:
* From the 3rd Quarter to 4th Qaurter, COGS (Cost of Goods Sold) doubled across all countries. This in turn caused a decrease in profits for USA, Mexico and France. The product which spiked in cost is normal paper, it cost more than double to sell in that time period.
* Germany and Canada are the only countries that increased their profits from 3rd quarter to 4th quarter. Germany increased sales to $3.11 million from $1.89 million while Canada increased sales to $3.48 million from $2.52 million. These increase in sales helped offset the increase in COGS.
* Whilst the Government sector is the companies biggest customer, it also receives a staggering 42.35% discount on products followed by small business with 38.17%.

I further tried my hand at creating a DBMS using Microsoft Access.

The prelimnary report gives an overview of the findings and insights that have been made based of the dashboard whilst the methodology and reflection report gives a personal report of what I experienced during the creation of this project.

This is by no means professional work but just a documentation of my work and applying the skills I've learnt so far.
