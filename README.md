# McBride-Enterprise

*McBride Enterprise sells different paper across the regions of Canada, USA, Mexico, France and Germany. Across these regions they sell products to the goverment sector and private businesses. McBride Enterprise needs to find out their performance of their business across the different regions and customer sectors.

*The data of the companies performance was readily available and little cleaning was needed; the integrity of the data was good. The company was needed to get a better and btter understanding of how the companies KPI's for each product in each region and sector across each quarter.

*The data was directly imported into PowerBi to create these interactive dashboards to give the key-decision makers more insights into the business performance.

*As a result key-decision makers have the neecessary KPI information to adapt accordingly to challanges the business is facing or opportunities that stand-out from the interactive dashboard.

I further tried my hand at creating a DBMS using Microsoft Access.

The prelimnary report gives an overview of the findings and insights that have been made based of the dashboard whilst the methodology and reflection report gives a personal report of what I experienced during the creation of this project.

This is by no means professional work but just a documentation of my work and applying the skills I've learnt so far.
